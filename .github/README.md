# StreamNative's fork of Apache Flink

This repository is maintained by StreamNative to host a StreamNative fork of the Flink Connector for Pulsar. Only the Flink Connector for Pulsar (including the Flink SQL Connector for Pulsar and the Flink DataStream Connector for Pulsar) diverges with the official Apache Flink repository.

The following is some useful documentation and resources for the DataStream and SQL Connectors

- [Flink SQL Connector for Pulsar documentation](../docs/content/docs/connectors/table/pulsar.md)
- [flink-example: cookbooks, examples](https://github.com/streamnative/flink-example)
- [StreamNative Hub documentation](https://hub.streamnative.io/data-processing/pulsar-flink/1.15.0.1)

> The legacy [pulsar-flink connector](https://github.com/streamnative/pulsar-flink) is deprecated. It will not be actively maintained and users are recommended to use this repository.
